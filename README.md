Some fun JavaScript snippets
============================

* __class_extensions__ #=> Flavor my JS
* __helpers__ #=> Some helper methods I may want to reuse
* __undo__ #=> My lightweight function for launching and managing undo message boxes
* __pregame__ #=> For loading images into the DOM
* __long_menu__ #=> For controlling overflow of long bootstrap menus without use overflow-y:hidden (which looks like crap in IE)
* __jutils__ #=> A very lightweight cross-browser utility object for DOM manipulations (event handlers, finders, etc)
